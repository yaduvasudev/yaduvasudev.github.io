#### {{< bi body-text color=#40CB2D >}} About this course

This is a basic graduate-level course that introduces some advanced data structures, algorithm design techniques. There will be a lot of emphasis on reasoning about the data structures and algorithms that you design, and formally proving the correctness of constructions. 

**Prerequisites** - A basic course in design and analysis of algorithms is necessary. The course will require you to design data structures and algorithms, and then mathematically prove their correctness. There **will not be any programming component** for this course, though you may be required to implement a few of the data structures and algorithms in CS6150 (Advanced Programming Lab).

  - Dictionary ADT - hash tables, skip lists, binary search trees
  - Priority Queue ADT - binary heaps, min-max heaps, mergeable heaps
  - Disjoint set ADT and applications
- Algorithm design
  - Greedy algorithms - scheduling, Huffman coding, MST
  - Dynamic programming - DP on strings, trees, DAGs, and graphs
  - Network flows and applications
- Intractability 
  - Notion of poly-time reductions
  - NP-completeness and its consequences

#### {{< bi book-fill color=#40CB2D >}} Course resources

There are many textbooks and resources (both offline and online) that cover most of the material presented in the list above. We will not be following one textbook. Our main sources of reference will be the following textbooks.

- **[E]** - [Algorithms](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/Algorithms-JeffE.pdf) by Erickson
- **[CLRS]** - Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein
- **[M]** - [Open Data Structures](https://opendatastructures.org/) by Morin
- **[DPV]** - Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani

All these books contain a number of exercise problems for practice.
